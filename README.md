# validata
### Continuous integration for your data

We do continuous integration on code. Why not data? 
Validata is a small package to run basic sanity checks on your data.
I haven't found anything that aggregates all of these checks and tricks in one place.
Initially, this will be a Python/NumPy only package running basic checks, but hopefully it becomes a resource of data sanity and sanitation checks.
Still very much a work in progress.
